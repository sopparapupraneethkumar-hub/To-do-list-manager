# To-do-list-manager
A console-based To-Do List Manager implemented in C++ using a singly linked list and file handling. This project demonstrates core Data Structures concepts such as dynamic memory allocation, pointer manipulation, and CRUD operations.

This application allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently through a menu-driven interface. Tasks are stored dynamically using a singly linked list, and data persistence is ensured using file handling.

The system supports adding, deleting, updating, searching, and marking tasks as completed. All tasks are saved to a text file and reloaded when the program restarts.
